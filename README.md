# Campus Events (CEM) 3.5.0

Plan campus events with your team: registrations, tasks, roles, UPI payment links, a chat inside every event, a budget with bills and vendors, public self-registration, QR tickets with scan-to-check-in, and an income and sponsor tracker.
Runs as an Android app (APK built by GitHub, no installs) and as a website. Everything fits in the free plans of GitHub and Firebase (Spark).

## What's new in 3.5.0: safer data, self-registration, QR tickets, sponsors
Everything stays on the free plans (GitHub, Firebase Spark, no Cloud Functions, no card). **This upgrade needs new `firestore.rules` and converts old events once, so read SETUP.md > Upgrade to 3.5.0 before you start** (about 20 minutes).

### 1. Permissions fixed (`firestore.rules`)
Before 3.5.0 any member could write any field of the event, including their own role, and the budget, vendors and bills sat in the event document where every member could read them. Now:

| Role | May change in the event document |
| --- | --- |
| Organizer (owner) | everything except who the owner is |
| Manager | everything except the owner, other managers' roles and the notification topic |
| Treasurer | their own tasks, people they add, teams, payment settings (`pay`), attendees (add and change, never delete), payment links, items to buy |
| Team lead | task groups, tasks, people they add, teams, attendees (add and change, never delete), items to buy, payment links |
| Member | tasks they may tick, people who report to them, teams, items they were given, payment links, and **adding** attendees (no check-in, no deleting) |
| Viewer | nothing |

- **Roles can only be changed by organizer and manager.** The owner can set manager, treasurer, lead, member, viewer; a manager can set treasurer, lead, member, viewer and cannot touch another manager or the owner. Everyone can still change their own display name or leave an event.
- **Money data moved to a staff-only document** `events/{id}/fin/data`: budget lines (`bud`), vendors (`ven`), vendor bills (`exp`), earlier payments (`payments`), donations (`don`) and the new sponsors (`spn`). Only organizer, manager and treasurer can read or write it. Members and viewers no longer receive it at all (before, the app only hid it).
- The conversion of an existing event is automatic: the first time the organizer or a manager opens the new app, the money data is copied to the staff-only document, removed from the event document, and the attendee array is converted. Nothing is overwritten and it is safe to repeat.

### 2. One entry per attendee
Attendees are stored as `regs.<id>`, one map entry each, the same way bills and vendors already were (`MAPK` in `www/sync.js`). Two gate volunteers checking in different people no longer overwrite each other. The app also writes **only the fields that changed** (`in`, `inAt`, `inBy`), so a check-in and a "paid" tick on the *same* person both survive. One Firestore document holds 1 MiB. That is plenty for a few hundred attendees (an attendee with a few answers is roughly 300 to 500 bytes). The rules stop at 1,500 entries as a safety net; **if you expect more than about 800 attendees, move attendees to a sub-collection** (`events/{id}/regs/{rid}`), which also allows rules per attendee.

### 3. Public self-registration (`register.html`)
Works like `pay.html`: public form, then pending, then approve.
- Attendees tab > **Open online registration** (organizer, manager, treasurer). You get a link and a QR code to share; the page shows the event, seats left and **your own registration form questions**. No account needed.
- **Duplicate check on College ID.** The application is stored under the College ID, so the same ID cannot apply twice (enforced by the rules, not just the page). Approving also checks the ID against the attendees you already have, and adding an attendee by hand does the same.
- **Waitlist.** When the seats are full the page says so and stores applications as *waitlist*. When a seat frees up, **Promote** (or **Promote next**) moves people in. Approval re-checks the seats, so the event can never be overbooked by the form.
- **Optional fee.** Set a ticket price and UPI ID (Price and settings). The page shows the UPI QR, exactly like a payment link, and an optional UTR box. Pay-later is fine. **Approve and mark paid** records the fee after you checked your UPI app.
- Free-plan cost: one write per application and one read per application per organizer device. A public form is tiny next to Spark's daily limits (50,000 reads, 20,000 writes).

### 4. QR tickets and scan-to-check-in
- Every attendee has a QR ticket (Attendees > **...** > **Ticket (QR)**). Share a ticket link (`ticket.html`), copy it, save the QR image, or send it by WhatsApp or email. Approved online applications show a **Ticket (QR)** button too.
- **Scan tickets** (organizer, manager, treasurer, team lead). **Android app:** the free `@capacitor-mlkit/barcode-scanning` plugin (Google's scanner screen). **Website:** the browser's built-in `BarcodeDetector` where it exists, otherwise the small `jsQR` library (`www/vendor/jsQR.js`, Apache-2.0, loaded only when needed). A box for typing a ticket code or College ID works everywhere.
- Already-checked-in tickets show a warning with the time and who checked them in. Unpaid fees show a one-tap **Mark as paid**.
- **Offline:** scanning uses the attendee list already cached on the phone and Firestore queues the check-ins until the network returns. Open the event once with a connection before the gate opens.

### 5. Income, sponsors, break-even, CSV export
- **Income tab** (organizer, manager, treasurer): for each sponsor (or donation / other income) the amount **committed**, the amount **received**, what you **promised** them and whether it is **delivered**.
- **Break-even:** `ticket price x seats + sponsorship` against total cost (your budget, or what you spent plus still have to pay, one tap to switch). It tells you how many tickets you need, how many registrations to go, or that even a full house falls short, with a bar showing income against the cost line.
- **Export data** (Details and Income tabs): attendees, payments, bills and sponsors as CSV, or everything in one ZIP. On Android it opens the share sheet (Drive, WhatsApp, Files). Cells starting with `= + - @` are escaped so spreadsheets never run them as formulas.

### Known limits (please read)
- The rules cannot loop over a map, so per-attendee field rules are not possible while attendees are map entries. They enforce the role table above (for example a member can add attendees but not check them in); a volunteer who is allowed to change attendees could still edit another attendee's fields.
- `tasks`, `team` and `teams` are still whole-field writes, so two people ticking different tasks at the same instant can overwrite each other (attendees, bills, vendors, items, payment links and sponsors cannot).
- Every member (including viewers) can still read the attendee list with College IDs, phones and emails. Money data is now staff-only; attendee contact details are not.
- The public registration form has no rate limit (Firestore rules cannot count requests). The College ID rule stops duplicates and the size limits stop huge documents, but someone could send many applications with different made-up IDs. Close the page, or delete applications (Remove), if that happens. Adding Firebase App Check later is the free next step.
- A QR ticket is a bearer ticket: whoever has the link or image can use it once (the second scan warns). The ticket id is 12 random characters, so it cannot be guessed.
- The new rules could not be run against the Firebase emulator when this release was prepared (it needs downloads that were not available). The app logic was tested against a mock database; **run the checklist in SETUP.md > Upgrade to 3.5.0 on a test event before you rely on it.**

## What was new in 3.4.0: a tidier event page
A redesign of the event screen. **Your data, sign-in, rules and Cloudflare Worker are untouched**, so upgrading is just replacing a few files (**SETUP.md > Upgrade to 3.4.0**, about 5 minutes, nothing to migrate).

**Where things are now**

| Tab | What is in it |
| --- | --- |
| **Details** (new) | Date, time, venue, description, seats, a tappable summary (registered, checked in, open tasks, people, budget left), the event code to invite people, your role, Edit / Delete / Leave. The old header card that repeated on every tab is gone; every tab now starts with just the event name. |
| **Attendees** | Search, filters (all / not checked in / checked in), one-tap **Check in**, and a **Register attendee** form that stays closed until you need it and is ready for the next person after each save. The **participant Team maker moved here** (switch between *Attendees* and *Teams* at the top). |
| **Tasks** | Task groups **and Items to buy** in one place, with one progress bar and one filter row (All / Mine and my team / To do / Done) that applies to both. Add forms open from "+ Add task" / "+ Add item". Ticking an item asks what it really cost. |
| **People** | Everyone on the event, sorted by role, with their role, task progress and phone. Add volunteers who have no account with "+ Add person". The role guide is one tap away. |
| **Payments** | Money coming in. Payments waiting to be checked are first, with filters; payment links come next; link settings are tucked away. |
| **Expenses** | Money going out: **Budget**, **Bills**, **Vendors** (see below). Only organizer, manager and treasurer see this tab. |
| **Chat** | As before. |

The tab bar scrolls sideways on a phone and shows small counters: attendees, open tasks, people, and in **red** payments waiting to be checked and overdue bills.

**Expenses & Budget, redesigned**
- **Summary card** at the top: how much you can still spend (or how far over you are), with one bar: solid = spent, hatched = still to pay.
- **Budget view**: one card per category with a status ("On track", "Almost used", "Over by ₹1,500"). Tap a card to see every bill and item inside it and to change the planned amount. Adding a category is one tap on a suggestion (Venue, Food, Decor...) plus an amount.
- **Bills view** (was "Payments to vendors"): what you owe, sorted with **overdue first** and labelled "Due in 3 days" or "Overdue by 2 days". **Pay via UPI** shows the QR code in place; **Mark paid** takes the mode and UTR. Paid bills are tucked behind "Show paid bills". The add form is short; to record something already paid, use **Add as already paid**.
- **Vendors view**: contact, UPI ID, how much you have paid and still owe each one, and an **Add bill** shortcut.
- Items to buy still count in the budget (bought = spent at the real cost, not yet bought = to pay at the estimate). The summary card links to them in Tasks.

**Small things**
- Deleting a task, a task group that has tasks, a team, a registration, a category, a vendor or a bill now asks first.
- Viewers can no longer register attendees or edit teams (they could before; the roles table already said read-only). Check-in still needs team lead or above.
- Cancelling "Edit event" returns to the event instead of the list. Opening an event lands on Details.

## What was new in 3.3.0
- **Sign in or sign up with Google**, on the website and inside the Android app. One tap, no password, no emailed code (Google has already confirmed the address). Email and password still work exactly as before.
  - **Website:** a Google pop-up (it switches to a full-page redirect if the browser blocks pop-ups).
  - **Android app:** a pop-up cannot work inside an app, so the app uses the free `@capacitor-firebase/authentication` plugin to get a Google token and signs in to Firebase with it. The rest of the app is unchanged.
  - **Free, no card:** Google sign-in is part of Firebase Authentication on the Spark plan. Do not upgrade to "Identity Platform".
- **Firebase's public sign-up must be switched back ON.** Google can only create new accounts while it is on. The bot protection that 3.2.0 got from switching it off now comes from `firestore.rules`: the database accepts only accounts with a **confirmed email**. Google accounts and OTP-Worker accounts are always confirmed; a bot-made account never is, so it can read and write nothing.
- **Old email accounts** that were created before the code step existed (never confirmed) get a Firebase confirmation link the next time they sign in, then sign in again. This is free and built in.
- Sign-out also forgets the Google account in the APK, so the next sign-in shows the account chooser.
- New helper workflow **Show signing key fingerprint (SHA-1)**, because Firebase needs that SHA-1 for Google sign-in in the APK.
- Setup: **SETUP.md > Upgrade to 3.3.0** (about 25 minutes). Until the Android part is done, the website works and the APK still builds; only the Google button inside the APK will not work.

## What was new in 3.2.0
- **Email code (OTP) when creating an account.** Choose "Create account", enter name, email and password, and a 6-digit code is emailed to you. The account exists only after you type the code. **Signing in never asks for a code.**
  - Stops bots and mass junk accounts: nobody can create an account without a real inbox, and (until 3.3.0) Firebase's own public sign-up was switched off so the code step could not be skipped. From 3.3.0 the database rules do that job instead; see above.
  - Extra guards: codes expire in 10 minutes, 5 wrong tries lock a code, one code per email per minute, 5 codes per email and 10 per network per hour, throwaway-mail domains (mailinator and similar) are refused, and an optional free captcha (Cloudflare Turnstile) and college-email-only mode can be switched on.
  - Still **free, no card**: a small Cloudflare Worker (`worker/otp-worker.js`) sends the code through Brevo (300 emails a day free) and creates the Firebase account. Firebase stays on the Spark plan; there are no Cloud Functions.
  - Setup is a one-time job of about 30 minutes: **SETUP.md > Upgrade to 3.2.0**. Until it is done, "Create account" shows "Sign-up is not set up yet" (sign-in keeps working).
  - Old APKs (3.1.x) cannot create accounts through the code flow. Set `min` to `3.2.0` (or `3.3.0`) in Firestore > appconfig > version to ask people to update.

## What was new in 3.1.0
- **Expenses tab** (Event > Expenses).
  - *Budget*: add budget lines (Food, Venue, Decor...) with a planned amount. Each line shows spent, still to pay, what is left and a bar that turns red when you go over.
  - *Vendors and parties*: save who you pay, with an optional UPI ID and phone.
  - *Payments to vendors*: record what you owe or have paid. For a vendor with a UPI ID, **Pay via UPI** shows a QR code and an "Open UPI app" button with the amount filled in. **Mark paid** stores the mode and UTR.
  - *Items to buy*: build a shopping list (item, quantity, estimated cost, category) and **allocate each item to a member**. The member gets an alert, sees the item under **My tasks**, and marks it bought with the real cost. A "Who is buying what" table shows each member's share.
  - Who sees what: organizer, manager and treasurer manage budget, vendors and payments. Organizer, manager, treasurer and team lead add and allocate items. Everyone else sees only the items list.
- **Payment links belong to the event.** A link stops working at the end of the event day (organizers can keep it open up to 30 extra days under Payments > Link expiry), and when the event is deleted its links and the payments submitted through them are deleted too. Expiry is enforced by the Firestore rules, so an old link cannot be used even if someone saved the page.
- **Change your name**: Account menu > Account, alerts & join event > Your name. It updates your name in every event you are in.
- **Chat**: fixed the scrolling (the chat now fills the screen and only the message list scrolls, the keyboard no longer closes when a sync arrives, new messages no longer jump the list). **Tag members** by typing @ or tapping the @ button; tagged people get an alert (Chat mentions) and see the message outlined.
- **Close buttons** on the account / alerts panel, the join-event popup and the About popup. The account panel also closes with Esc or by tapping outside.

## What was new in 2.0.0
- **Event chat.** Every shared event has a Chat tab, like a group chat. Names show their role, for example `Rohit (Treasurer)` and `Ronit (Member)`.
  - People who join later can read the whole history ("Load older messages" pages back 40 at a time).
  - Edit or delete your own message within 2 hours of sending. Organizer and managers can delete any message.
  - The chat is deleted together with the event.
  - Long messages are compressed to save space; the unread dot and alerts keep Firestore reads low.
- **Task descriptions.** Add a brief when you create a task (or later with "+ Brief"). It is folded by default; tap "Brief" to open or close it. Assignees see it in My tasks too.
- **Animated logo loader** while the app starts, on the app, sign-in and payment pages, so the first screen never looks blank.
- Roles, payment links and sign-in work as before.

## Build the APK
### Option A: no installs, GitHub builds it for you
1. Create a new GitHub repository and upload everything in this folder (keep the .github and scripts folders).
2. **One time only:** create the permanent signing key (see "APK updates and signing" below). Without it the build stops with a clear error.
3. Open the Actions tab, pick "Build APK", click Run workflow (it also runs on every push to main).
4. When it finishes (about 5 minutes), download "campus-events-apk" from the run page and unzip it.
5. Copy campus-events-vX.Y.Z.apk to your phone and open it. Allow "Install unknown apps" if asked. Over an older version it shows "Update", not "Install".

### Option B: build on your computer
Needs Node 20, JDK 17 and Android Studio.

    npm install
    npx cap add android
    npx cap sync android
    npx cap open android     (then Build > Build APK)

## APK updates and signing
Android installs a new APK **over** the installed app only when all three are true:
1. same package name (`com.campus.events`),
2. signed with the **same key** as the installed app,
3. a **higher `versionCode`** than the installed app.

If any one fails, the phone shows "App not installed as package conflicts with an existing package", "package already installed" or just refuses the update.

### What was wrong and what changed
- The old workflow printed only a warning when the signing key was missing and carried on, so that build got a **random key**. Every build with a random key is a different "developer" to Android and can never update the previous one. It now **stops with an error** instead.
- The key was found only through the hidden default path `~/.android/debug.keystore`. `scripts/patch-android.sh` now writes the key path into `android/app/build.gradle` explicitly.
- `versionCode` used GitHub's `run_number`, which does not rise on a re-run and restarts at 1 in a new or copied repository, so a new APK could look older than the installed one. It is now the number of minutes since 1970: it always goes up.
- After building, the workflow runs `apksigner` and **fails if the APK is not signed with the permanent key**. The run summary shows the certificate fingerprint and the version code, so you can compare builds.

### One-time setup of the permanent key
1. Choose a long passphrase and **save it somewhere safe** (password manager). If it is lost, the key is lost.
2. GitHub repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret. Name: `KEYSTORE_PASSPHRASE`, value: your passphrase.
3. Actions > **Create signing key (run once)** > Run workflow. It adds `signing/debug.keystore.gpg` (encrypted) to the repository. It refuses to overwrite an existing key. Never delete this file or change the secret afterwards.
4. Actions > **Build APK** > Run workflow. In the run page, open the summary and note the **signing certificate SHA-256**. It must be the same on every later build.

### One-time cleanup of the phone (only if updating already fails)
An app installed from a build that used a random key (or a different key) can never be updated. Remove it once, then install the new APK:
1. Optional: open the app and make sure your events are synced (shared events live in Firebase; events kept only on that phone are lost on uninstall).
2. Long-press the app > Uninstall (or Settings > Apps > Campus Events > Uninstall). If you use several profiles or a work profile, uninstall it in each.
3. Install the new `campus-events-vX.Y.Z.apk`.
4. From now on every APK from this repository installs as an **update** and keeps your data.

### Checks and troubleshooting
| What you see | Cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| Build fails at "Restore permanent signing key": secret missing | Add `KEYSTORE_PASSPHRASE` (step 2 above), then run the build again. |
| Build fails: `signing/debug.keystore.gpg is missing` | Run "Create signing key (run once)". |
| Build fails: `gpg: decryption failed` | The secret does not match the passphrase used to create the key. Put back the original passphrase. If it is lost, delete `signing/debug.keystore.gpg`, set a new secret, run "Create signing key" again, and do the phone cleanup above once. |
| Build fails: `APK is NOT signed with the permanent key` | Something overrode the signing config. Check that `scripts/patch-android.sh` ran. |
| Phone still says package conflict | The installed app was signed with a different key. Do the phone cleanup once. |
| Phone says it cannot downgrade | The installed app has a higher `versionCode` than this APK (for example it came from a build made by someone else). Uninstall once. |
| Check from a computer (USB debugging on) | `adb shell dumpsys package com.campus.events | grep -E "versionCode|versionName"` shows the installed version. |

Notes: the app version people see (`APP_VERSION` in www/ui.js) and Android's `versionCode` are separate. Bump `APP_VERSION` for what users read; `versionCode` is set automatically on every build. If you build on your computer (Option B), make sure the same key is used, otherwise that APK cannot update one built by GitHub.

## Notes
- **Google sign-in and the confirmed-email rule (3.3.0).** `firestore.rules` has one switch, `requireVerifiedEmail()`, set to `true`. Leave it on. Turning it off while Firebase's public sign-up is on lets bots create accounts that can use your free Firestore quota.
- **Google sign-in in the APK needs three things to line up:** the SHA-1 of your permanent key registered in Firebase, the Android app registered with package name `com.campus.events`, and the `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` secret downloaded *after* the first two. Phones without Google Play services cannot use the Google button (email sign-in still works).
- Event data is cached on the phone and synced through Firebase. Chat and payment links need a shared event.
- Since 3.5.0 the budget, vendors, bills, donations and sponsors live in a separate document that only organizer, manager and treasurer can read (see above). Items to buy, tasks, attendees and payment links are still in the event document, which every member can read, so do not share an event code with people you do not trust with attendee details.
- **Sign-up codes and free limits.** Brevo's free plan sends 300 emails a day, so at most about 300 codes a day (a resend is another email). Cloudflare's free plan is 100,000 requests a day and 1,000 stored writes a day; each code request uses 2 of those writes, so roughly 400 requests a day before it pauses. Nothing but sign-up is affected when a limit is reached: sign-in goes straight to Firebase.
- **What the code does and does not do.** It proves the person owns the email address and makes bulk sign-up slow and costly. It cannot stop someone who really owns many inboxes. Turn on the Turnstile captcha and `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` (for example your college domain) in the Worker for stronger protection.
- Keep the Firebase service-account key and the Brevo key only as Cloudflare secrets. Never put them in this repository. The `worker/` folder is not part of the website or the APK.
- The APK is a debug build for sideloading, signed with your permanent key so it updates in place. For Play Store, create a separate signed release build.
- To change the app, edit the files in www/, push to GitHub, and the workflow rebuilds the APK. Bump `APP_VERSION` in www/ui.js on every release.
